# OnTrack Admin Panel Fixes & Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Vector Store Functionality Fixed

**Problems:**
- Vector stores not working properly with file uploads
- No proper naming and description support
- Confusing user associations

**Solutions:**
- Enhanced `createVectorStoreWithFiles()` method to handle uploaded files properly
- Added support for custom names and descriptions
- Improved file upload validation and error handling
- Updated database schema to track file counts and descriptions

### 2. ✅ Assistant Management Improved

**Problems:**
- Assistant creation was limited/not working
- No file upload capability for assistants
- Confusing user associations in the UI

**Solutions:**
- Created `createSharedAssistant()` method for creating shared assistants
- Enhanced assistant creation to support vector store connections
- Added proper assistant type indicators (shared vs user-specific)
- Improved UI to show assistant connections clearly

### 3. ✅ UI/UX Improvements

**Problems:**
- Assistant-vector store connections showed user emails (confusing)
- No way to see which users are assigned to which assistant
- Missing bulk operations

**Solutions:**
- Updated Vector Stores tab to show connected assistants instead of user emails
- Added "View Users" button for each assistant to see assignments
- Added bulk instruction update feature
- Improved card layouts with better information display

### 4. ✅ Backend API Enhancements

**New Routes Added:**
- `GET /api/admin/assistants/:assistantId/users` - View users assigned to an assistant
- `PUT /api/admin/assistants/bulk-update-instructions` - Bulk update all assistant instructions
- Enhanced vector store creation with proper file upload handling

**Improved Routes:**
- `POST /api/admin/assistants` - Now creates shared assistants properly
- `PATCH /api/admin/assistants/:assistantId` - Enhanced update functionality
- `POST /api/admin/vector-stores` - Improved file upload and metadata handling

## OpenAI API Configuration

### Which API Account?
The system uses **YOUR OpenAI API account** configured via environment variables.

### Required Environment Variables:
```bash
# In your .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### How It Works:
1. **Shared Resources**: Assistants and vector stores created through admin panel are shared across all users
2. **User Assignment**: Users can be assigned to existing shared assistants
3. **Multi-User Support**: Multiple users can use the same assistant without conflicts
4. **Cost Management**: All API calls go through your OpenAI account

## New Features

### 1. Assistant Management
- **Create Shared Assistants**: Create assistants that multiple users can access
- **View User Assignments**: See which users are assigned to each assistant
- **Bulk Updates**: Update instructions for all assistants at once
- **Vector Store Connections**: Connect assistants to specific knowledge bases

### 2. Vector Store Management
- **File Upload**: Upload documents during vector store creation
- **Naming & Description**: Proper metadata for each vector store
- **Assistant Connections**: See which assistants use each vector store
- **File Tracking**: Track number of files in each store

### 3. User-to-Assistant Assignment
- **Flexible Assignment**: Assign users to any shared assistant
- **View Assignments**: See all users assigned to each assistant
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor user status and activity

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a Shared Assistant:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Assistants tab
2. Click "Create New Assistant"
3. Fill in name, instructions, model selection
4. Optionally connect to a vector store
5. Assistant becomes available for user assignment

### Creating a Vector Store:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Vector Stores tab
2. Click "Create New Vector Store"
3. Upload files, add name and description
4. Vector store becomes available for assistant connections

### Assigning Users to Assistants:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Users tab
2. Use the "Assign Assistant" dropdown for each user
3. Or go to Assistants tab → Click "View X assigned users"

### Bulk Operations:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Assistants tab
2. Click "Bulk Update Instructions"
3. Enter new instructions (use `{USER_ID}` for personalization)
4. All assistants will be updated

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema:
- `openai_assistants` table supports `user_id = NULL` for shared assistants
- `vector_stores` table tracks file counts and descriptions
- Proper foreign key relationships for data integrity

### File Upload:
- Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- 50MB file size limit
- Supported formats: .txt, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .md
- Files stored in `/uploads` directory and uploaded to OpenAI

### Security:
- Admin-only access to all management features
- JWT authentication required
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

## Cost Management

### OpenAI Usage:
- Vector stores use your OpenAI storage quota
- Assistant API calls count against your usage limits
- File processing uses your token allowance

### Optimization Tips:
1. Reuse vector stores across multiple assistants
2. Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard
3. Set up usage alerts in your OpenAI account
4. Consider assistant instruction length (affects token usage)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **File Upload Fails**: Check file size limits and formats
2. **Assistant Creation Fails**: Verify OpenAI API key is valid
3. **Vector Store Empty**: Ensure files are in supported formats
4. **Bulk Update Fails**: Check internet connection and API key

### Debugging:
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Monitor Network tab in browser for API response errors
- Verify environment variables are properly set
- Check OpenAI dashboard for quota and usage information
